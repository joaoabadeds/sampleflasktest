# The World Simpliest Flask Application EVER

## Running

You just need to execute `python app.py`. TCP port is defined in the code. The environment variable `NUB_PASS` is neccesary to define application token.

## Calling the API

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Token NUB_PASS_TOKEN_VALUE" http://localhost/
```

**Please feel free to change this application.**
